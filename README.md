# Create-a-NFT-Collection

In this I have created a variable that can hold a number of NFTâ€™s
& i have created an object inside my mintNFT function that will hold the metadata of my NFTs.
My metadata values will be passed to the function as parameters. When the NFT is ready, it will store it in the variable that i created.
